For now, NCL30 is just a repository for NCL30-related subprojects (see
the TODO file)
So you must compile and install each subproject in a certain sequence,
to satisfy the internal dependencies. See the README file in each subproject.

In the future, many other projects will be included here, such as:
NCL30-XMTO-Converter, NCL30-SMIL-Converter etc.
