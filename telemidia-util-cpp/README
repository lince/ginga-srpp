This is the TeleMidia Util library.

The autogen.sh script does all the magic calls to automake/autoconf and
friends that are needed to configure the compiling environment.

DEPENDENCIES
============
-> libtool  >= 1.3.4
-> autoconf >= 2.13
-> automake >= 1.4

INSTALLATION
============
As mentioned above, autogen.sh does all the `configure' magic.
So the installation steps are:
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ make
   $ make install
If you need to customize any path or regular `configure' value, please
refer to the INSTALL file.
